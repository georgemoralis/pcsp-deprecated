PCSP is a work in progress coded in C++ which allows psp emulation and can already run several commercial games.

To ease the archiving and launching of PSP games, some open source third party applications are proposed here :

pcsp-udb : this application acts as a database of PSP games you can consult, edit or launch (calling the external PCSP emulator).

pcsp-xmb : this application mimics a PSP XMB to launch a PSP game (calling the external PCSP emulator).



Informations regarding the PCSP emulator can be found at http://www.pcsp-emu.com
